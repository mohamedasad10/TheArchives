# 🧠 TheArchives

A full-stack personal archive web app for storing the details of your purchases, items, and prescriptions so you never forget important information again.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

This app was born from a real-life need.

> Recently, our microwave broke. But we didn’t know how much it originally cost, when we bought it, or where we bought it from so comparing or replacing it was frustrating.  
>  
> Another instance was my doctor prescribed medicine, but I forgot the **name** and **dosage** later when I needed it again.  

I realized I needed a place to store this kind of item-related information for future reference and that's when **TheArchives** was created.
